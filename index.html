                <h1><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE – COVID-19 </strong></h1>

                <p>In light of the increases risk of COVID-19 community transmission, we have made a number of important changes to how the practice will be run for the foreseeable future</p>

                <h3><strong>Booking Appointments:</strong></h3>
                <p>In an effort to move away from face-to-face consultations, we ask that all patients phone in advance if you need to book an urgent appointment. If there is an urgency, we ask to you call ahead for an appointment and when you arrive for your appointment that you stay in your car and call the surgery on 045 531636. Please do not come into the surgery until directed to by reception staff or a doctor.</p>
                <h3><strong>Attending Appointments:</strong></h3>
                <p>If you have an appointment and are over 18 please attend the surgery alone. If you are under 18 only one other person may go with you to the surgery. When you arrive please sit in your car and call the reception on 045 531636 - Please do not come into the surgery until directed to by reception staff or a doctor.</p>
                <h3><strong>Prescription Requests: </strong></h3>
                <p>Please allow 48 hours for your prescription to be filled – we can then arrange for your prescription to be sent to your pharmacy. You can request your prescription online using the link.</p>
                <h3><strong>Certs: </strong></h3>
                <p>We can arrange to post work certs and social welfare certs to your address. Please give 48 hours for these to be completed</p>
                <br>
                <p>In the case of an Emergency please call 999</p>
                <br>
                <p>Thank you for your co-operation and understanding. These changes will help reduce the risk of spreading Coronavirus and ensure that we can remain open.</p>
